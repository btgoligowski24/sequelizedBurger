# sequelizedBurger

## What Problem Does the App Solve
This app is a continuation of me learning express.js and express-handlebars. It reinforces CRU requests and how to use those to handle traffic and views. It is introduces me to sequelize as an ORM. 

## App Overiew
The app is organized by using standard MVC format.

## How to Use the App
1. Navigate to https://serene-meadow-35844.herokuapp.com/
1. You have the following options:
    * Click the "DEVOUR IT" button to eat the burger, moving it to the eaten column.
    * Click the "MAKE ME ANOTHER" button to create another of the same burger, putting it in the available column.
    * Create a whole new burger by entering its name in the text box and then clicking "Add Burger".
2. Voila, you've used the app. It should refresh the page after each interaction.

# burger

## What Problem Does the App Solve
This app is a continuation of me learning express.js. It reinforces CRU requests and how to use those to handle traffic and displays. It is also my first introduction to ORMs and express-handlebars. This ORM I created myself as to understand what's going on behind the scenes, but it's also to show that it is much nicer with a pre-built library.

## App Overiew
The app is organized by using standard MVC format.

## How to Use the App
1. Navigate to https://mysterious-retreat-22990.herokuapp.com/
1. You have the following options:
    * Click the "DEVOUR IT" button to eat the burger, moving it to the eaten column.
    * Click the "MAKE ME ANOTHER" button to create another of the same burger, putting it in the available column.
    * Create a whole new burger by entering its name in the text box and then clicking "Add Burger".
2. Voila, you've used the app. It should refresh the page after each interaction.
